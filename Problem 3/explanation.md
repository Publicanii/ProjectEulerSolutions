1. Start with the number A.
2. Set pf = 2 (the first possible factor).
3. Repeat while `pf` is less than or equal to square root of A:
   * If A is divisible by pf:

     * Print pf.
     * Divide A by pf.
   * Otherwise, increase pf by 1.
4. After the loop, if A > 1, print A.
5. The last number printed is the largest prime factor.

**Addition** : It can also be used for factorizing of other numbers.
