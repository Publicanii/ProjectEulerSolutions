# Publicanii Software and Finance Team

Publicani is -for now- a small software and finance team. Founded by two University students, Publicanii tries to do its best.

# Project Euler Solutions

A collection of Python solutions to Project Euler problems. The Publicanii team absolutely does not intend to openly share the answers and methods to Project Euler's questions and thereby hinder users from experiencing the mathematical pleasure of solving problems. 
All solutions and explanations here are provided solely to show an alternative, different perspective. The Publicanii team has great respect for all of Project Euler's rules and the Project Euler community it is part of. 

## Structure

Each problem is organized in its own directory containing:
- `problemX.py` - Python solution implementation
- `explanation.md` - Step-by-step explanation of the solution approach

## Running Solutions

Navigate to any problem directory and run:
```bash
python problemX.py
```
